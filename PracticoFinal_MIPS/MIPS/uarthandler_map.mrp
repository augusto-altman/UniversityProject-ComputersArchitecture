Slice Logic Distribution:
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                      108 out of   4,556    2%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        2,782
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,278 out of   2,782   45%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 181 out of   2,782    6%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:       1,323 out of   2,782   47%
    Number of unique control sets:              20
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              61 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
